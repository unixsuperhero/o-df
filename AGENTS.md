# o-df: agent guide

`o-df` (so `o df`) finds and clears disk hogs. Usage, keys and the culprits file are in README.md. It is an [ochazuke](https://github.com/unixsuperhero/ochazuke) application (ochazuke's `AGENTS.md`, "Building an application on ochazuke", and its Invariants apply unchanged) with [oden](https://github.com/unixsuperhero/oden) dispatch.

## Plans and todos

Plans and todos are kept outside this repository; do not add a TODO.md or docs/plans/ here. Open an issue instead.

## Where does X live

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| The culprit row, the embedded defaults, the user file merge, path expansion | `culprits.go`, `culprits.json` |
| Resolving a culprit word (exact, alias, unique prefix, oden's descendant rule, did-you-mean) | `resolve.go` |
| The parallel walk (allocated bytes, one volume, hard links once), disk totals | `walk.go`, `stat_*.go` |
| Probing a culprit, sizes and ages as text | `probe.go` |
| clear and relocate (copy, verify, delete, link), the home guard | `actions.go` |
| `App`, the runtime, the culprit verbs, key rows, rows and cells | `app.go` |
| The page | `view.go` |
| `tui`, `--smoke` | `tui.go` |
| `main`, oden dispatch, `scan`, `top`, `free`/`delete` (culprit clear at the top level) | `main.go` |

## Invariants

- No special cases: every culprit is a row of data (paths, rebuildable, size command, clear commands, advice). Code never branches on a culprit's name. A new hog is a row in `culprits.json` or the user's file.
- No personal setup in the defaults: `culprits.json` names no volume (`relocate_to` is unset; relocate without `--to` or the user's `relocate_to` fails) and no folder layout (per-project rows use `{project_root}`, filled from the user's `project_roots`, empty by default).
- clear acts only on rebuildable rows, after the verb's confirm (several culprits or `--all`: one question from the `clear-many` verb check, listing each with its size and the total; `--all` never includes a row that is not rebuildable); relocate never overwrites, verifies before it deletes, and refuses the source's own volume. Both refuse `/`, the home directory and its parents.
- The walk never follows a symlink and never crosses into another volume; a path resolving onto another volume is skipped unless a row, the file or a flag sets `external` (`Env.Elsewhere`, the `deviceOf` hook in tests). Walks are bounded (`ProbeTimeout`, `top --timeout`) because a stuck directory read never returns.
- Tests run on a temp HOME fixture only.

## Checks

```sh
gofmt -l . && GOWORK=off go vet ./... && GOWORK=off GOFLAGS=-trimpath go test ./...
GOWORK=off go run . tui --smoke
```

ochazuke (`v0.50.0`) and oden (`v0.1.1`) are required at their tags; never commit a `go.work` or a `replace`.
